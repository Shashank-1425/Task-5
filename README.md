## Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project performs an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the famous **Titanic dataset**.

The main goal is to extract insights using both **statistical summaries** and **visual exploration**.

---

## Steps Followed:

1. **Data Loading and Basic Information**
   - Used `.info()`, `.describe()`, and `.value_counts()` to explore the dataset.
   - Identified missing values and data types.

2. **Visual Exploration**
   - Plotted **pairplot** to study relationships between multiple features.
   - Plotted **heatmap** to visualize correlation between variables.

3. **Distribution Analysis**
   - Created **histograms** to study distribution of features like Age, Fare, SibSp, and Parch.
   - Used **boxplots** to detect outliers.
   - Used **scatterplots** to identify relationships between Age and Fare with respect to Survival.

4. **Observations**
   - Higher Fare and First-Class (Pclass=1) passengers had higher survival rates.
   - Females had much better survival rates than males.
   - Younger passengers generally survived more.
   - Fare distribution was right-skewed with some high-value outliers.

5. **Summary of Findings**
   - Majority of passengers (~62%) did not survive.
   - Passenger Class, Fare, Gender, and Age significantly impacted survival chances.
   - Dataset needs handling for missing values and outlier treatment for deeper analysis.
